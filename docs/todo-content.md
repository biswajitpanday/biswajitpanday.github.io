## Visual Fatigue Analysis

**Definition:** Visual fatigue occurs when users experience cognitive overload from too many competing visual elements (colors, animations, gradients, information density).

**Current state assessment:**
- Gradient usage: Present but part of established design system
- Animation density: Reasonable with purpose
- Color variety: Controlled via 5-color hierarchy
- Information density: Main concern - too much content visible at once

**Primary visual fatigue sources:**
1. **44 certifications** visible at once → Solution: Task 31.2 (organize display)
2. **Multiple stats sections** → Solution: Task 33.1 (needs approval)
3. **Gradient on many headings** → Solution: Task 33.3 (needs approval)

**Phases 30-32 will address visual fatigue by:**
- Reducing perceived content overload
- Better organizing information hierarchy
- Adding clear visual separation (Pre-2020 section)
- Maintaining animations (they're not the problem)
