    longDescription:
      "Architected and implemented a centralized authentication and subscription management system from the ground up for RegAnalytics' product suite (World Tax Analyzer, Transfer Pricing Analyzer, and other tools). Built using ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API with Entity Framework for data persistence. Designed and developed token-based authentication (JWT), single sign-on (SSO) across multiple products, role-based access control (RBAC), and subscription tier management. Implemented secure session handling, password policies, and audit logging for enterprise compliance. This internal platform streamlined user management across all RegAnalytics products, reducing authentication-related development effort for product teams by centralizing security concerns.",
